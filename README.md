# finite-monkeys

according to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem>wikipedia</a>, the infinite monkey theorem states that "a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will <i>almost surely</i> type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare."

to simulate this theorem, the mamaMonkey script produces 100 monkeys that will try their little monkey hearts out to make the next word in Shakespeare's Hamlet. additionaly, you can send the output through a twitter client using the friendly TweetMonkey in the output module.
